## Prepare Webhook URL

To create a legacy incoming webhook, go to https://slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook.

To create an incoming webhook, go to https://api.slack.com/apps, and create a new app, and an incoming webhook from there.

Go to GitHub, and Settings > Secrets > Actions > Repository secrets, and create `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` to test.

## How to Develop

```
$ git checkout pre
```

```

Send PR from  `pre` branch to `main` branch, and merge it.

## How to Release
